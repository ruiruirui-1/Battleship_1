# Battleship_1
A game that player to hit computer-generated ships
This is a prototype for the Battleship game(2) I made.
Originally, this game is to let computer generates ships and let players to hit all ships. Of course, at first, player cannot see where the computer sets the ships.
Players will need to try on the map displayed for them and manage to find out where ships are hidden.
There are feedbacks for each step player taken. For example, if player hits nothing, then the block player just hit will change and player will know that the
latest step hit nothing.
